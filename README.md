## Testing the plugin

If you want to test the collabora activity plugin on a local Moodle installation and a local Collabora Online Server via docker then you may find the [Collabora-Config.md](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-mod_collabora/blob/master/Collabora-Config.md) file helpful.

## Use of other Online Editors as Collabora Online, such as LibreOffice Online

This plugin should also work with the use of LibreOffice Online (LOOL) - which is the base product of Collabora Online - if you set up an LibreOffice Onliner server as described in the documentation of the [Document Foundation](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnline).
